# BF3 Trading Style – Beyond Indicators, Beyond Illusions

**BF3** is not just another trading method. It’s a high-precision, institutional-grade framework designed for traders who want to see the market through the eyes of smart money and algorithms.

Developed by **B.Falahpour**, BF3 is based on three pillars:  
**Volume – Price – Time**  
But unlike others, BF3 doesn’t use them traditionally. It deconstructs the market fractally, based on **behavior, flow, and structural shift**.

## Core Philosophy of BF3

- **Fractal Candle Structure (Real-Time)**  
  Candles are dynamically built — not by minute, tick, or volume — but by real-time conditions, delta pressure, volume clusters, speed, and flow changes.

- **No Dependency on Indicators**  
  BF3 doesn't rely on RSI, MACD, or even traditional VWAP. It decodes the **institutional intent** directly from the order book, Level 2, and live volume behavior.

- **One Setup in All Markets**  
  There are not 10 different strategies. There’s **only one true setup** at any price zone, based on behavior under/over key liquidity points.

- **Risk is Structure-Based, Not Guess-Based**  
  Entry, stop, and target are calculated based on where the market is **inside or outside the risk zones**, not based on support/resistance fantasies.

## Key Differentiators
